        <h2> Crispy cheesy pan pizza recipe from grandma's kitchen </h2>
            <h3> Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> 2 cups (240 grams) all-purpose flour (such as King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose
                         Flour) </li>
                    <li> 3/4 teaspoon fine salt (like table salt or fine sea salt) </li>
                    <li> 1/2 teaspoon instant yeast or active dry yeast </li>
                    <li> 3/4 cup (170 grams) lukewarm water </li>
                    <li> 1 tablespoon (13 grams) olive oil plus 1 1/2 tablespoons (18 grams) olive oil
                         for the pan </li>
                    <li> 6 ounces (170 grams) low-moisture mozzarella, grated (about 1 1/4 cups, loosely
                         packed)* </li>
                    <li> 1/3 to 1/2 cups (74 grams to 113 grams) tomato sauce or pizza sauce, homemade or
                         store-bought </li>
                    <li> Freshly grated hard cheese and fresh herbs for sprinkling on top after baking,
                         optional* </li>
                </ul>
            <h3> Steps </h3>
            <ol>
                <li> Weigh your flour, or measure it by gently spooning it into the cup, then sweeping
                     off any excess. </li>
                <li> Place the flour, salt, yeast, water, and 1 tablespoon (13 grams) of the olive oil
                     in the bowl of a stand mixer or other medium-large mixing bowl. </li>
                <li> Stir everything together to make a shaggy, sticky mass of dough with no dry patches
                     of flour. This should take 30 to 45 seconds in a mixer using the beater paddle; or
                     about 1 minute by hand, using a spoon or spatula. Scrape down the sides of the bowl to
                     gather the dough into a rough ball, then cover the bowl. </li>
                <li> After 5 minutes, uncover the bowl and reach a bowl scraper or your wet hand down between
                     the side of the bowl and the dough, as though you were going to lift the dough out. Instead
                     of lifting, stretch the bottom of the dough up and over its top. Repeat three more times,
                     turning the bowl 90 degrees each time. This process of four stretches, which takes the place of
                     kneading, is called a fold. </li>
                <li> Re-cover the bowl, and after 5 minutes do another fold. Wait 5 minutes and repeat, then another
                     5 minutes and do a fourth and final fold. Cover the bowl and let the dough rest, undisturbed, for
                     40 minutes. Then refrigerate it, covered, for a minimum of 12 hours, or up to 72 hours.
                     (Alternatively, if you don't have room in your fridge for the bowl, transfer the dough to a
                     gallon-sized ziplock bag with a little extra olive oil to coat the inside of the bag.) It'll
                     rise slowly as it chills, developing flavor; this long rise will also add flexibility to your
                     schedule. </li>
                <li> About 3 hours before you want to serve your pizza, prepare your pan. Pour 1 1/2 tablespoons
                     (18 grams) olive oil into a well-seasoned cast-iron skillet that’s 10 inches to 11 inches diameter
                     across the top, and about 9 inches across the bottom. Heavy, dark cast iron will give you a superb
                     crust, but if you don’t have it, use another oven-safe heavy-bottomed skillet of similar size, or 
                     10-inch round cake pan or 9-inch square pan. Tilt the pan to spread the oil across the bottom,
                     and use your fingers or a paper towel to spread some oil up the edges, as well. </li>
                <li> Transfer the dough to the pan and turn it once to coat both sides with the oil. After
                     coating the dough in oil, press the dough to the edges of the pan, dimpling it using
                     the tips of your fingers in the process. The dough may start to resist and shrink
                     back—that’s okay, just cover it and let it rest for about 15 minutes, then repeat the
                     dimpling and pressing. At this point the dough should reach the edges of the pan—if it
                     doesn’t, give it one more 15-minute rest before dimpling and pressing a third and final
                     time. </li>
                <li> Cover the crust and let it rise for 2 hours at room temperature. The fully risen dough will look
                     soft and pillowy and will jiggle when you gently shake the pan. </li>
                <li> About 30 minutes before baking, place one rack at the bottom of the oven and one toward the top
                     (about 4 to 5 inches from the top heating element). Heat the oven to 450°F. </li>
                <li> When you’re ready to bake the pizza, sprinkle about three-quarters of the mozzarella (a scant
                     1 cup) evenly over the crust. Cover the entire crust, no bare dough showing—this will yield
                     caramelized edges. Dollop small spoonfuls of the sauce over the cheese (don't spread it!)—laying
                     the cheese down first like this will prevent the sauce from seeping into the crust and making it
                     soggy. Sprinkle on the remaining mozzarella. </li>
                <li> Bake the pizza on the bottom rack of the oven for 18 to 20 minutes, until the cheese is bubbling
                     and the bottom and edges of the crust are a rich golden brown (use a spatula to check the bottom).
                     If the bottom is brown but the top still seems pale, transfer the pizza to the top rack and bake
                     for 2 to 4 minutes longer. On the other hand, if the top seems fine but the bottom's not browned
                     to your liking, leave the pizza on the bottom rack for another 2 to 4 minutes. Home ovens can vary
                     a lot, so use the visual cues and your own preferences to gauge when you’ve achieved the perfect
                     bake. </li>
                <li> Remove the pizza from the oven and place the pan on a heatproof surface. Carefully run a table
                     knife or spatula between the edge of the pizza and side of the pan to prevent the cheese from
                     sticking as it cools. Let the pizza cool very briefly, then as soon as you feel comfortable doing
                     so, carefully transfer it from the pan to a cooling rack or cutting surface. This will prevent the
                     crust from becoming soggy. </li>
                <li> Serve the pizza anywhere from medium-hot to warm. Kitchen shears or a large pair of household
                     scissors are both good tools for cutting this thick pizza into wedges. </li>
            </ol>
            <p> Out of all the styles of pizza, we’ve chosen Crispy Cheesy Pan Pizza as our 2020
                Recipe of the Year. With its crispy golden edges, gooey layer of cheese (right to the edge!),
                and thick yet delicate crust, it has a texture and taste that make you want more. Plus, the
                crust has just five simple ingredients: it’s easy to pull off in a home kitchen. </p>
            <p> Our recipe incorporates four baking 'tricks.' An untraditional, nearly no-knead method
                of folding the dough creates airy pockets in the crust. An overnight refrigerated rest
                allows the dough time to develop maximum flavor. Baking in a cast-iron pan makes an audibly
                crispy crust for your flavorful assortment of toppings. And finally, the unique layering of
                cheese beneath the sauce acts as a barrier to minimize sogginess. </p>
